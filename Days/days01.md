<h1>Introduction to DevOps - Day01</h1>

Hello everyone!

Before we start our journey of 90daysofDevOps, I want to add that I am very excited for this journey. I was thinking of learning DevOps for around a month and today finally I had taken a step to learn DevOps in the next 90 days. I will include all the resources and that I am using. I will focus on keeping it short and simple. 

I will follow **KISS** principle for learning the DevOps that is **"Keep It Simple, Stupid"**

Okay, Let's the Journey begin.

## What is DevOps?
1. DevOps is a combination of two words that is Development and Operation. 
2. It is a methodology that allows single team to manage the entire application development life cycle, that is development, testing, deployment and operations.
3. The objective of devops is to shorten the system's development life cycle.
4. DevOps is a software development approach through which superior quality software can be developed quickly and with more reliability.
