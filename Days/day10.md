# Day 10 - Introduction to Git

1.	Git is an open source software.
2.	It is a Distributed Version Control System
The difference between centralised and Distributed version control system 

## Centralised Version Control System(CVCS)

1.	In Centralised Version Control System, a client need to get local copy of source from server and do the changes and commit those changes to control source on server.
2.	CVCS systems are easy to learn and setup.
3.	Working on branches is difficult in CVCS. Developer often faces merge conflicts.
4.	CVCS system do not provide offline access.
5.	CVCS is slower as every command need to communicate with server.
6.	If CVCS server is down, developers cannot work.

## Distributed Version Control System(DVCS)

1.	In DVCS, each client can have a local repository as well and have a complete history on it. Client need to push the changes to branch which will then be pushed to server repository.
2.	DVCS systems are difficulty for beginners. Multiple commands needs to be remembered.
3.	Working on branches is easier in DVCS developer faces less conflicts.
4.	DVCS system are working fine on offline mode as a client copies the entire repository on their local machine.
5.	DVCS is faster as mostly user deals with local copy without hitting server everytime.
6.	If DVCS server is down, developer can work using their local copies.
