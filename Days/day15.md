# Day 15 - Basic Of Computer Networking

### Hardware
The term hardware is used to refer to the physical components of any electronic devices such as the CPU, peripheral Devices and its memory.
1. It is the physical unit of a device.
2. It is a complete unit or Device.
3. It can be changed after production.
4. It is the body of the device. Eg: Keyboard, Remote, Speakers, Motherboard.
5. Hardware cannot operate without a firmware.

### Firmware
Firmware is a set of instructions or programs written in Machine Language which are used to operate hardware.
1. It is a set of instructions.
2. It is stored in hardware.(Not accessible by user)
3. It cannot be or hardly changed after production.
4. It is the heart of the device. Example: Timing and control mechanism of washing machine, TV Program and Remote.
5. A firmware operate on a hardware.

### Software
A collection of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a particular task. There are two types of software.
a. System Software          b. Application software
some points related to software
1. Software is generally stored in user accessible memory.
2. Software is changed constantly.
3. Software can be very big while firmware are usually small. Example: Operating System, MS-Office, Google Crome.

## Transmission Mode in Computer Network
  Transmission  mode means transferring of dta between two devices.
  
### Simplex Mode
 1. Communication is unidirectional.
 2. Only one device on a link can transmit, the other can only receive.
 3. Example: Keyboard, FM Receiver, TV

### Half Duplex
1. Each statin can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.
2. When one device is sending the other can only receive and vice-versa.
3. Example: Walkie-Talkie

### Full Duplex Mode
1. Both station can transmit and receive simultaneously.
2. Capacity of the link is shared among the two.
