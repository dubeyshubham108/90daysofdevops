# Day 2- DevOps Lifecycle

DevOps means implementing automation at each and evey stage. There are seven steps involved in DevOps Lifecycle. They are listed below.
1. Continuous Development
2. Continuous Integration
3. Continuous Testing
4. Continuous Monitoring
5. Continuous Feedback
6. Continuous Deployment
7. Continuous Operations

Let's have a look of each one of them one by one

## Continuous Development
a. Goal and vision of the project is decided

b. Coding of the software

c. Tools used git, IDE's, slack

</p>

## Continuous Integration
a. Source code in the central repository is regularly updated.

b.  This process also involves unit testing, integration testing, code review, and the packaging of the code written by the developers.

c.Tools used Jenkins, GitLab, etc.

</p>

## Continuous Testing
a. Code written by developers is sent to testers where they use automated tools to test it for bugs.

b. Can schedule to run the tests automatically at a predefined time. The report generated in this phase is sent back to the developers where they make necessary updates to the code to remove the bugs.

c. Tools used Selenium, Junit(for testing Java code).

</p>

## Continuous Monitoring
a. It involves checking the performance and the reliability of the code.

b. Also check the infrastructure as the code move from development to deployment.

c. Tools used in this phase are Nagios, Sensu, etc

</p>

## Continuous Feedback
a. Feedbacks from the user is taken with the help of surveys, questionnaires, and focus groups.

b. Feedbacks are also taken with the help of social media platform such as Twitter, Facebook,etc.

c. Tools used is Pento

</p>

## Continuous Deployment
a. Application is deployed on the production surver.

b. Tools used is AWS CodeDeploy, Octopus Deploy, Jenkins, etc.

</p>

## Continuous Operations
a. The goal of this phase is to increase the uptime or the time the users can use the application. 

b. Tools used is Kubernetes, Docker.
